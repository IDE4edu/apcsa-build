value
	The information contained in a variable or represented by a constant;
	more generally, the result of evaluation of an expression.
variable
	A named box, or storage location, that contains a particular kind of data, its value.
	A variable may contain only one value, but this value may change 
	as the result of an assignment statement.
parameter
	In general, a particular value that is substituted for a general term.  
	In Java, a parameter is listed in the method header, where it says 
	what kind of information must be passed to the method so that the method
	may perform its action successfully.  Compare argument.
expression
	Any legal Java representation of a value.  A variable or constant is the
	simplest expression; more complicated expressions include operators or
	method calls.
evaluate (an expression)
	Compute the value of. 
argument
	A value passed to a method when the method is executed.
assignment statement
	A Java statement that has three parts, a variable name (the "left hand side"
	of the assignment), an equals sign, and an expression (the "right hand side"). 
	It is executed by first evaluating the right hand side, then storing the 
	resulting value into the variable named on the left hand side.

	?
object
	An instance of a class.
class
